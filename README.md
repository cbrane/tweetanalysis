# Social Media/ Tweet Analysis Chatbot ü§ñ

## Vision & Purpose
This Social Media Analysis Chatbot is an educational tool designed to bridge the gap between complex social media analytics and practical understanding. Born from the need to make social media analysis more accessible and educational, this project combines state-of-the-art NLP techniques with interactive learning features to help users not just analyze their social media content, but truly understand what the metrics mean and how to improve their social media presence.

### Why This Project?
- **Educational Focus**: Traditional social media analytics tools provide metrics but often lack explanations. Our tool focuses on teaching users what these metrics mean and how to use them effectively.
- **Interactive Learning**: Instead of just displaying numbers, we provide interactive explanations, practical examples, and actionable insights.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: By combining multiple NLP models with educational AI, we offer both depth in analysis and clarity in explanation.

## üåü Features

### Core Analysis Capabilities
- **Multi-Model Sentiment Analysis**: Combined analysis using VADER (specialized for social media), Transformers, and NLTK for comprehensive sentiment understanding
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Advanced POS tagging, named entity recognition, and key phrase extraction
- **Basic Metrics**: Essential metrics like word count, character count, sentence structure, hashtags, mentions, and URLs
- **Content Analysis**: Sophisticated topic modeling with BERTopic, writing style assessment, and engagement metrics
- **Educational Insights**: LLM-powered explanations that break down complex metrics into understandable concepts

### Interactive Learning Features
- Real-time analysis with instant educational feedback
- Detailed explanations of each metric in plain language
- Best practices and actionable improvement suggestions
- Interactive chat interface for deeper understanding
- Thread detection and analysis for context awareness
- Emoji and emoticon analysis for social media relevance
